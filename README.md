# Python Library Classes by SkillChef

This repository contains the official code files, examples, and projects for the **Python Library Classes** instructed by [Your Name] on behalf of **SkillChef**.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as the central hub for students enrolled in the Python Library classes. Here, you will find all the practical materials needed to follow along with the course lectures and complete your hands-on assignments. The code is organized to demonstrate the concepts and techniques taught throughout the curriculum.

## 🐍 What are Python Libraries?

A Python library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and modules that developers can use to perform common tasks without having to write code from scratch. Think of them as a set of tools or a toolkit that extends the capabilities of the Python language.

For example:
*   **NumPy** is used for scientific computing.
*   **Pandas** is used for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** is used for creating visualizations.
*   **OpenCV** & **PIL** is used for image processing.

By using libraries, programmers can work more efficiently and focus on solving higher-level problems.
